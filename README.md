<h1>🚀 Industrial Training Projects at Biz Insights IT Solutions 🔍</h1>

<p>During our industrial training at <b>Biz Insights IT Solutions</b>, we worked on a range of exciting projects, gaining valuable hands-on experience in different technologies. Here's an overview of our key projects:</p>

<h2>1. Web Scraping with Python 🐍</h2>
<p>We started by scraping product details from <b>Amazon</b> and <b>Flipkart</b> for price comparison. This evolved into a larger project where we scraped address and contact details of <b>80+ car dealers in the USA</b>.<br>
Additionally, we scraped reviews and ratings of <b>4200+ car dealers</b> across platforms like <b>Google</b>, <b>Facebook</b>, <b>BBB.org</b>, <b>Cars.com</b>, <b>DealerRater</b>, and <b>Yelp</b> using custom Python scrapers for each.</p>

<h2>2. COVID-19 Patient Prediction System 🦠</h2>
<p>We built a <b>machine learning model</b> to predict the likelihood of a person having <b>COVID-19</b> based on their symptoms.<br>
The model was deployed using <b>Flask</b> and hosted on an <b>AWS EC2</b> instance. This system helps healthcare workers prioritize patients and efficiently manage resources.</p>

<h2>3. AWS Implementation Projects ☁️</h2>
<p>We worked on multiple tasks using various <b>AWS services</b>, including:<br>
- <b>AWS Lambda</b><br>
- <b>AWS S3</b><br>
- <b>AWS Kinesis</b><br>
- <b>AWS DynamoDB</b><br>
- <b>AWS Cloud Trails</b><br>
- <b>AWS Athena</b><br>
- <b>API Gateway</b><br>
These tasks gave us practical experience with cloud computing and enhanced our skills in AWS services.</p>

<h2>4. Django Hotel Management System 🏨</h2>
<p>We designed and developed a <b>hotel management system module</b> using <b>Django</b>, enabling hotel administrators to manage bookings, guest information, and services efficiently.</p>
